# AIWeek

This repo follows my journey through evaluating the latest AI technologies starting Jun 20, 2023... All of my experiments and sources will be open sourced so you too can follow along.

## My Background

- I have been following the AI revolution closely on Twitter (give me a follow @TJEvarts)
- I developed my own 0-layer NN from scratch in vanilla JS when I was a teen (a long time ago). I trained it to detect the language of an input word.
- I am fluent in JS, Python, HTML/CSS, C, C++, etc.

## My Goals

- Find tools that I can safely implement into my workflow to increase my productivity and creativity
- Evaluate the current state of AI tech and understand the implications of where it is headed in the short term
- Build my underlying AI understanding and skillset
