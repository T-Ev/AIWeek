# Day 0 - Basics

So, I realize that this is an ambitious goal of becoming an expert on the latest AI tools in 7 days. For me by the end hopefully I won't even be writing these notes and logs myself.

I believe the key will be to exponentially build my knowledge base from the ground up. Spend a lot of time on foundational universal principles and skills, which will take longer, then build up to huge advances and using new tools.

But what are the basics? I am glad you asked! I want to start with understanding the groups of AI tools and choosing which ones I want to evaluate together. Here is the categories I came up with:

1. Proprietary LLMs/chatGPT plugins
2. Open source LLMs
3. Fine tuning/Prompt Engineering
4. Tools: Langchain/autogpt/babyagi
5. Audio: Speech to text/text to speech/music generation
6. Video: Text to video
7. Spacial: depth maps, video->3d, nerf
8. Images: Image generation/diffusion models

Yes, yes I know there are 8 categories, I figure I can merge two together like audio and video.

### The "BIG IDEA TM"

Simultaneously, I want to invent the "BIG IDEA TM". The "BIG IDEA TM" is a project that will be worked on for the length of this AI week and ideally do accomplish something useful/cool, and require all of the new skills I will be learning. This should result in a final Demo ready to be shown at the end of Day 7.

### Other Random Thoughts From Today

I also came across the Hugging Face Leaderboard for Open Source LLMs. These are probably what I am most excited to play with and fine tune on my local machine.

I also really like the work being done by Liam Ottley on youtube. He is focusing on the applications of AI, which is super interesting.

Finally, I intend to heavily use Andrej Karpathy's youtube course to build my foundation. I plan to watch one of his lecture videos each day. Conveniently there are 7 videos total. I watched the first one today.

## My Background

- I have been following the AI revolution closely on Twitter (give me a follow @TJEvarts)
- I developed my own 0-layer NN from scratch in vanilla JS when I was a teen (a long time ago). I trained it to detect the language of an input word.
- I am fluent in JS, Python, HTML/CSS, C, C++, etc.

## My Goals

- Find tools that I can safely implement into my workflow to increase my productivity and creativity
- Evaluate the current state of AI tech and understand the implications of where it is headed in the short term
- Build my underlying AI understanding and skillset

## Tools and Resources

Other goals for today will include setting up the following tools for the rest of the week:

| Tool          | Level                    | Cost             |
| :------------ | :----------------------- | :--------------- |
| chatGPT       | Pro                      | $20              |
| Google Collab | Pro                      | $10              |
| Poe           | subscribe                | $0 - 7 Day Trial |
| Replit        | free (may upgrade later) | $0               |
| Notion        | free                     | $0               |

Also at my disposal I have my server:

- Intel i7
- NVIDIA 3090
- 16GB RAM

And my desktop:

- AMD 5800X
- NVIDIA 3080
- 16GB RAM

## Key Takeaways from today:

- "Fine Tuning an LLM is not adding new information to the model, but rather training it to recognize or respond with a certain pattern"

# Plan For Day 1

## Proprietary LLMs/chatGPT plugins

## Videos to watch

- Video 2 from Andrej: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY

## Models to Evaluate

- GPT-4
- Anthropic 100k
- GPT-3.5 (already have a bunch of experience)
- Bard
- Plugins

## Evaluation Method

- Coding
  - Function creation
  - Debugging
  - Understanding of libraries
- Content
  - Poetry
  - Twitter/social media posts
  - blog posts
  - legal documents
- Knowledge
  - History
  - Geography
  - Physics
- Creativity
  - Ideation
  - Planning
  - Counseling
  - Psychology
  - Philosophy

(I will probably need to set up a test suite for this)

### Methodology

- Each model will be asked to respond 3 times and the best of the three answers will be used to compare

## Exercise

- Build my own chatGPT plugin
  - Ideas:
    - Bible Verse Plugin
    - Quote plugin
      - https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes
- Build my own chat local chat interface to compare the results of the different models
  - Use Langchain for prompt templating

## The "BIG IDEA TM"

- Brainstorm a list of potential projects
